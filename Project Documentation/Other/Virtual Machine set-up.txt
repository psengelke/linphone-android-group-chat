Working off this link from Paul, this is how I proceeded to set-up a Virtual Ubuntu Machine in VirtualBox and get it up and running with linphone android development

VM specs:
64-bit Ubuntu 15.04 with 6GB ram and a BIG hdd (I recommend 25GB minimum as all the libraries and tools are very big when extracted and installed)

Notes on steps

I installed scite as I like that text editor

step 2
run
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

Step 7:
In Ubuntu .bashrc is hidden, so you won't see it in home with ls command in terminal. It is there though.
Edit it with the following command:
sudo scite ~/.bashrc

Step 8:
after step 7, close all terminal windows and relaunch terminal
run
android avd
now create a device and attempt to run it. There will likely be errors if you running 64-bit linux.
Install the required dependencies with the following:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32z1-dev lib32ncurses5 

Step 9:
When setting sdk and ndk preferences do the following:
at "SDK Location:" enter or browse to the path of sdk which should look like this:
/home/USERNAME/anroid-sdk-linux
Expand the >Android bullet in the left menu and select NDK.
Enter or browse for the NDK Location which should look like:
/home/USERNAME/android-ndk-r10e

Step 10:
I encountered a problem with aclocal. could not locate package.
Same thing for libtoolize and pkgconfig. Don't think they're actually available for ubuntu 15.04 x64

for libtoolize, run
sudo apt-get install libtool

step 11:
install git
run
git clone http://github.com/psengelke/linphone-android-group-chat --recursive


Step 12:

Get an error here about target 'checktools.mk'
