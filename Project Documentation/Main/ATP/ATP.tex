\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This document describes the plan for testing the development and functionality of the extended Linphone application software against the
user requirements as defined in the Software Requirements Specification document [SRS]. The purpose of this acceptance test is to make sure
that the system developed during the Linphone extension project complies with the requirements listed in the SRS. These tests are executed in the Acceptance Test (AT) phase of the project.

\subsection{Scope}
The Linphone application is based on a distributed system. It ranges from a wide variety of technologies and incorporates a wide range of aspects. The extension to Linphone enables users to create, manage and participate in group chats with the side choice of using encryption while doing so. By hiding all complexity from the main server it makes the system easier to use, implement and test. Usability is also increased by providing an interactive user interface as a front-end for the users to interact with.

\subsection{Test Environment}
Several aspects play a role in the testing environment. These include equipment used to test the product, technologies used, the environmental/surrounding conditions and other factors.\\
\textbf{Equipment}\\
The equipment used to test the extended functionality for the project will be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Computer/Laptop with necessary IDE's and testing environment.
\item Provided cellular phones with appropriate operating system and application set.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technologies}\\
The technologies used to test the functionality are mainly software oriented and include:
\begin{itemize}
\item JUnit for unit testing
\item Eclipse IDE
\item Linux Environment
\item Java JRE 1.8
\item Android SDK
\item Android NDK
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test Conditions}\\
Several factors describe the test conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Testing will take place in an integrated environment
\item The project is developed in a Linux environment using the Eclipse IDE. Thus testing will take place within the development paradigm using software to assist in unit and integration testing.
\item Since the project is a development for an android device, the bulk of the testing will occur on an android device. The specific device to be used will be the Zest cell phone.
\item All necessary actions are performed. In order to see the application in a certain state, we need to physically perform every step to get us there (clicking buttons, filling in text boxes, sending messages etc.).
\item The only thing that is mocked during the testing is data, such as message content.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Expected Result to Pass Test}
In order for the application to pass this test a new group chat should be created without any unexpected problems. The appropriate preconditions and postconditions should be met.
\subsubsection{Result: Pass}
A group chat was successfully created. The postconditions were all met.

\subsection{Test 2: Send Invite}
\subsubsection{Description}
An invite shall be sent to each user added to the group upon creation or when a new member is added to the group. Thus this test is divided into two sub-tests.

\subsubsection{Test 2.1: Invite Sent on Group Chat Creation}
\paragraph{Description:}
 A new group chat will be created and a check will be performed as to whether the added participants receive the invite to join the group chat.
 \paragraph{Preconditions:}
 For each of the pre-conditions below an exception is raised where that precondition is not met, to indicate service refusal.
 The invite will not be sent if one of the following scenarios occurs:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The receiver of the invite is a contact added by the administrator of the group.
 \end{itemize}
 \paragraph{Postconditions:} The postconditions specify the conditions which must hold true when the service has been provided.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The invite must be sent to the correct user.
 \end{itemize}
\paragraph{Expected Result to Pass the Test:}
In order for the application to pass this test the members added to the new group chat created must receive an invite to participate.
\paragraph{Result -- Pass:}
Invites were received and the post conditions were met.

\subsubsection{Test 2.2: Invite Sent on Group Chat Addition of Member}
\paragraph{Description:}
 An existing group chat will be edited by adding a new member to participate in the group chat. It will be checked whether the newly added member receives an invite for the group chat.
  \paragraph{Preconditions:} For each of the pre-conditions below an exception is raised where that precondition is not met, to indicate service refusal.
  The invite will not be sent if one of the following scenarios occurs:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The receiver of the invite is a contact added by the administrator of the group.
  \end{itemize}
  \paragraph{Postconditions:} The post-conditions specify the conditions which must hold true when the service has been provided.
  \begin{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
\paragraph{Expected Result to Pass Test}
In order for the application to pass this test the member added after the group chat was created must receive an invite to participate.
\paragraph{Result -- Pass:}
On group chat creation, the members added to the group received invites. The postconditions were met.
\subsection{Test 3: Delete Group Chat}
\subsubsection{Description}
A user shall be able to leave a group chat. When all the users leave a group chat, it will be deleted. If only one person remains in a group chat, that person will be unable to send messages to the chat until at least one other person is added to the chat. If the group owner leaves the group, a new owner is automatically assigned.
\subsubsection{Preconditions:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The user must be part of a group.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Postconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The chat is locally deleted from the user's phone.

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Expected Result to Pass the Test}
In order for the application to pass this test the group chat in question must be deleted and removed from the members profile. All post-conditions must take place.
\subsubsection{Result -- Pass:} Group chat was successfully locally deleted. All postconditions were met.

\subsection{Test 4: Update Group Chat}
The group name, subject, and members may be changed. Thus this use case is divided into three major sub-tasks (Update group chat descriptions, add member, remove member) with minor subtasks within each task.
\subsubsection{Test 4.1: Update Group Descriptions}
\paragraph{Description:} Here a group description, such as a name or subject will be changed and saved. It follows that each member on the corresponding group chat's profile will be updated with the correct information.
\paragraph{Expected Result to Pass the Test:}
Descriptions must be updated successfully in all relevant places.
\paragraph{Preconditions:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item A group exists and has members.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Postconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The current name or subject has been changed.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Result -- Pass:} Descriptions were successfully updated. All postconditions were met.

\subsubsection{Test 4.2: Add Member}
\paragraph{Description}
The administrator shall be able to add new users to the group. Once a new member is added it will be tested that the member receives the invite and is linked to the specific group chat.
\paragraph{Preconditions:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Group exists with an administrator in it.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Postconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user is added to the list of current users in the group and receives messages, etc.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Expected Result to Pass the Test:}
New member receives an invite to participate in group chat and is then linked to the group chat. New member can then send and receive messages on the group.
\paragraph{Result -- Pass:}
Member was successfully added to the group. All postconditions were met.
\subsubsection{Test 4.3: Remove Member}
\paragraph{Description:}
The administrator shall be able to remove members from the group. That user is removed from the list of users currently in the group.
\paragraph{Preconditions:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item A group exists with more than one member.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Postconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user is no longer a part of the group which entails the user not receiving messages/notifications from the group.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Expected Result to Pass the Test:}
The user no longer has access to the group chat, thus cannot participate. All left over members' member lists within the group chat are updated to one less member.
\paragraph{Result -- Pass:}
Member was successfully removed from the group. All postconditions were met.
\subsubsection{Test 4.4: Change Administrator}
\paragraph{Description:}

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Expected Result to Pass Test:}
The message appears as sent at the senders end and is received by the rest of the group members.
\subsubsection{Result -- Pass:}
Messages were successfully sent. All postconditions were met.

\subsection{Test 6: Receive Message}
\subsubsection{Description:}
A message object sent on a group shall be received
by every member subscribed to a group.
\subsubsection{Preconditions:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item A message object has been broadcast to all users subscribed to a particular group.
\item The user receiving an incoming message should be subscribed to the
group from which the message is broadcast.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Postconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The message will be displayed on the group chat interface.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Expected Result to Pass the Test:}
All sent messages are received on the corresponding group chat members devices.
