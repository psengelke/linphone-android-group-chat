\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This document describes the plan for testing the development and functionality of the extended Linphone application software against the
user requirements as defined in the software requirements specification document [SRS]. The purpose of this acceptance test is to make sure
that the system developed during the Linphone extension project complies with the requirements listed in the SRS. These tests are executed in the Acceptance Test (AT) phase of the project.

\subsection{Scope}
The Linphone application is based on a distributed system. It ranges from a wide variety of technologies and incorporates a wide range of aspects. The extension to Linphone enables users to create, manage and participate in group chats with the side choice of using encryption while doing so. By hiding all complexity from the main server it makes the system easier to use, implement and test. Usability is also increased by providing an interactive user interface as a front-end for the users to interact with.

\subsection{Test Environment}
Several aspects play a role in the testing environment. These include equipment used to test the product, technologies used, the environmental/surrounding conditions etc...\\
\textbf{Equipment}\\
The equipment used to test the extended functionality for the project will be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Computer/Laptop with necessary IDE's and testing environment
\item Provided cellular phones with appropriate operating system and application installation
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technologies}\\
The technologies used to test the functionality are mainly software oriented and include:
\begin{itemize}
\item JUnit for unit testing and integration testing
\item .............................
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test Conditions}
Several factors describe the test conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Testing will take place in an integrated environment
\item The project is developed in a Linux environment using the Eclipse IDE. Thus testing will take place within the development paradigm using software to assist in unit and integration testing.
\item Since the project is a development for an android device, the bulk of the testing will occur on an android device. The specific device to be used will be the Zest cell phone.
\item All necessary actions are performed. In order to see the application in a certain state, we need to actually perform every step to get us there (clicking buttons, filling in text boxes, sending messages etc).
\item The only thing that is mocked during the testing is data such as message content etc
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Equipment Configuration \& Test Case Setup Instructions}


\section{Test Procedures \& Verification Results Record}
\subsection{Test Procedures Summary}
All tests will involve testing the use case preconditions and postconditions.
The following is a list of tests are to be performed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create group chat
\item Send Invite
\item Delete Group Chat
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Test 1: Create group chat}
\subsubsection{Description}
A user shall be able to create a new group.\\
\textbf{Preconditions:} For each of the pre-conditions below an exception is raised where that precondition is not met, to indicate service refusal.
The group will not be created if one of the following preconditions is not met:
\begin{itemize}
\item User must have access to the Linphone service.
\item The user may not create the group unless at least one other member is added.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Postconditions:} The post-conditions specify the conditions which must hold true when the service has been provided.
\begin{itemize}
\item The creator is automatically assigned administrator rights.
\item An invite is sent to the other added users to ask them if they want to be part of the group.
\item The group is created with the respective profiles and members.
\item An error is displayed if the user attempts to create a group with less than two members in it.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Expected Result to Pass Test}
In order for the application to pass this test a new group chat should be created without any unexpected problems. The appropriate preconditions and postconditions should be followed.
\subsubsection{Result}


\subsection{Test 2: Send Invite}
An invite shall be sent to each user added to the group upon creation or when a new member is added to the group. Thus this test is divided into two sub-tests.

\subsubsection{Test 2.1: Invite sent on group chat creation}
\paragraph{Description}
 A new group chat will be created and checked whether the initially added participants receive the invite to join the group chat.\\
 \textbf{Preconditions:} For each of the pre-conditions below an exception is raised where that precondition is not met, to indicate service refusal.
 The invite will not be sent if one of the following scenarios occurs:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The receiver of the invite is a contact added by the administrator of the group.
 \end{itemize}
 \textbf{Postconditions:} The post-conditions specify the conditions which must hold true when the service has been provided.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The invite must be sent to the correct user.
 \end{itemize}
\paragraph{Expected Result to Pass Test}
In order for the application to pass this test the members added to the new group chat created must receive an invite to participate.
\paragraph{Result}

\subsubsection{Test 2.2: Invite sent on group chat addition of member}
\paragraph{Description}
 An existing group chat will be edited by adding a new member to participate in the group chat. It will be checked whether the newly added member receives an invite for the group chat. \\
  \textbf{Preconditions:} For each of the pre-conditions below an exception is raised where that precondition is not met, to indicate service refusal.
  The invite will not be sent if one of the following scenarios occurs:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The receiver of the invite is a contact added by the administrator of the group.
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Postconditions:} The post-conditions specify the conditions which must hold true when the service has been provided.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The invite must be sent to the correct user.
  \end{itemize}
\paragraph{Expected Result to Pass Test}
In order for the application to pass this test the member added after the group chat was created must receive an invite to participate.
\paragraph{Result}

\subsection{Test 3: Delete Group Chat}
\subsubsection{Description}
A user shall be able to leave a group chat. When all the users leave a group chat, it will be deleted. If only one person remains in a group chat, that person will be unable to send messages to the chat until at least one other person is added to the chat. If the group owner leaves the group, a new owner is automatically assigned.\\
\textbf{Preconditions:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The user must be part of a group.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Postconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The chat is locally deleted from the user's phone.
\item The user is removed/unlinked from the group chat.
\item If the user leaving is the administrator: The administrative privileges are assigned to another group member.
\item If the user is the last user in the group, their ability to send messages  to the group is locked.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Expected Result to Pass Test}
In order for the application to pass this test the group chat in question must be deleted and removed from the members profile. All post-conditions must take place.
