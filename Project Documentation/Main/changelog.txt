------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+++++++ Singleton ++++++++
--	LinphoneGroupChatManager, LinphoneGroupChatListener, GroupChatStorage made singleton.
	Reason: The original idea, though not portrayed in the SDD. Allows for easier access by other classes
	and ensures a single instance for interaction.

+++++++ GroupChatStorage ++++++++
-- 	GroupChatStorage add functions:
--- createGroupChat(String groupId, String groupName,  EncryptionType encryptionType, LinkedList<GroupChatMember> memberList)
--- updateMemberPublicKey() //used for updating public keys when accepting invite
	
-- 	Group chats shall be held separate from private chats for simplicity's sake as well as a convenience to clients.

--		Updated GroupChatMember to have two simple string values for an address and display name.

--		Added GroupChatData class for easier data passing and management between the data storage and the manager.

+++++++ Communication ++++++++

--		Message types added to LinphoneGroupChatRoom.
--		Message type is determined by LinphoneGroupChatRoom and passed to appropriate EncryptionStrategy function.
--		Added MessageParser for parsing structured messages for some forms.
