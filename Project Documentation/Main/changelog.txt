--	LinphoneGroupChatManager, LinphoneGroupChatListener made singleton.
	Reason: The original idea, though not portrayed in the SDD. Allows for easier access by other classes
	and ensures a single instance for interaction.
	
-- 	GroupChatStorage implementations should be implemented as singletons  to enforce a single database access 
	point. This shall be reflected in GroupChatStorageAndroidImpl.
	
-- 	Group chats shall be held separate from private chats for simplicity's sake as well as a convenience to clients.
