Guys, my suggestion is to do the final demo a bit differently. I would like to direct a question at each of you, which you then answer. Think along the lines of a simple talk show. It will be unique, more chilled, and easy to be very prepared for. It will also be more professional, with one presenter, while still adhering to the COS way of everyone says something.

I'll give an introduction about how we experienced the module (This will engage with Vreda and Fritz)
I'll then direct a question at each of you. You are welcome to have a slide or few, but it will also be fine if you don't.
after the questions, I'll demo our app.
?? Perhaps we can make a video of it mock working and play that??
?? I want to print all of our documentation and have it on hand for the demo. It's impressive
